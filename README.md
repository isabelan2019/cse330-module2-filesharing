Creative Portion:
1. We created a functionality on the login page allowing for nonexisting users to create a username and add themsevles to our file sharing system. If successful, the new user can navigate to the login page and access their newly created account.
2. We created a "RENAME" input and button that allows for users to rename an existing file in their folder by inputting a valid new file name. If successful, the renamed file will appear in their list of files.
3. We created a "SHARE" input and button that allows for users to enter an username of another existing user and share with them a copy of a file. If successful, users will be redirected to a "success" page.
